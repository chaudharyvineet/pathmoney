          <p>Being declined a loan due to lack of a bank account could be dissapointing but it is not something to lose sleep over. Many people who have had their initial loan application rejected went on to become eligible for the loan, and there’s absolutely no reason why you can’t do the same.</p>
          <div>

          <p>It actually doesn’t take much to open a bank account, and you can open one even when you are practically living from one paycheck to another. </p>

          <div class="sub_heading">Why Do You Need a Bank Account?</div>
              <div class="body_font">
          <p>Nowadays, most lenders, if not all, provide the loan money through electronic fund transfer. So you need a bank account in Canada to receive the loan amount after your loan application has been accepted and processed. </p>
          <p>However, a bank account helps in other ways, too. Lenders offer different types of personal loan plans, with some having lower annual percentage rates of interest and fees than others. When a lending company perceives a borrower as a low-risk, it is more prepared to offer him or her a cheaper loan plan. </p>
          <p>A bank account gives you the opportunity to show the lender that you earn regular income and manage your personal finances efficiently. This might make you eligible for a better loan. </p>
          <p>So, in all situations when you need a personal loan, having a bank account helps. Opening a bank account in Canada is fairly easy, even when you are just about getting by. Many banks are willing to open a checking account with a nominal deposit of $5 while a few don’t even require that.</p>

        <div class="sub_heading">Chose a type of Bank Account</div>
        <br>
        <p>First, decide which type of bank account you want—checking or savings. The difference between the two is in the intended use. The documents required for opening both are usually the same.</p>
        <div>
          <ol>
            <li>Checking Account</li>
            <p>A checking account is designed for paying bills and covering everyday money transactions, like buying groceries or gas. It might require an opening deposit—although often this can be nominal, say $5. There’re no withdrawal restrictions on checking accounts, but they usually don’t earn any interest, either. If you need a bank account for daily use, go for a checking account.</p>
            <li>Saving Account</li>
            <p>Do you want to open an account to save money for a specific purpose? If yes, a savings account is what you need. This kind of account is designed for minimal access and that’s why they have withdrawal restrictions. You can withdraw up to a specific number of times per month—usually 3-6 times—and up to a specific portion of the total amount. A saving account earns interest, but the interest rate varies from one bank to another.</p>
          </ol>

        <br>
        <div class="sub_heading">Documents you will require</div>
        <p>Once you’ve decided the type of bank account you want, you can visit the selected bank in person or logon to their website. You’ll need the following documents to open a bank account in Canada.</p>
        <div>
          <ul>
            <li>ID Proof – Driver license, Social Security Number, Birth Certificate, or Passport</li>
            <li>Address Proof – Utility bill or lease in your name</li>
            <li>Deposit – This varies from bank to bank and typically ranges from $5 to $100 </li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <p class="text-muted">Note: If you are opening a bank account online, scan the relevant documents and attach them with the form. If the account requires a minimum deposit, use your credit card or someone else’s account to make the initial deposit. <p>

          <p>Final Thoughts</P>
          <p>To sum it up, if your loan application has been rejected because you don’t have a bank account in Canada, the best way to have it approved is by opening a bank account. Having a bank account makes you eligible for better loans, which otherwise might be closed to you. Nevertheless, if you don’t want a bank account, then too you can get a personal loan. However, in this case, you would have to pay more.</p>
